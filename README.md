## Hi there 👋 I'm  I am [Bruno](https://brunogriep.github.io/) (a.k.a "bgf") 

## 𝙰𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝 𝙼𝚎 
I' currently working as an Advanced Consultant Engineer (Embedded Systems Engineer) for [Capgemini Engineering - Porto](https://www.capgemini.com/pt-en/portugal-offices/). I’m a Electronics Engineer nearing the completion of my master’s degree by the end of September in the fields of Signal Processing and Deep Learning, both Bachelor and Master course from [UFSC](https://en.ufsc.br/). Furthermore, I’ve also acquired a Technical degree in Electronics. I´d been working with embedded systems from the begging of the Electronics Engineering course, being able to work with Bare-metal programming, Embedded Linux, RTOS, Digital Signal Processing, Deep Learning, etc...

⚡ Fun fact: *bgf* is the abreviation of my full name, and is also my nickname in every multiplayer game that I've ever played.

  - CI/CD Pipelines to improve code quality
  - Modern C++ applied in Embedded Systems (linux/rtos/bare-metal)
  - DSP for audio FX applications
